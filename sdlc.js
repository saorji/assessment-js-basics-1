// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const analysisOfRequirements = 'is the process of determining user expectations for a new or modified produc'

const design = 'Software design is a process to transform user requirements into some suitable form, which helps the programmer in software coding and implementation'

const implementation = 'Software implementation refers to the process of adopting and integrating a software application into a business workflow'

const testingAndIntegration = 'is a type of software testing in which the different units, modules or components of a software application are tested as a combined entity'

const maintain = 'is the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes'
